**Abstract**:
In reinforcement learning, we can learn a model of future observations and rewards, and use it to plan the agent’s next actions. However, jointly modeling future observations can be computation- ally expensive or even intractable if the observa- tions are high-dimensional (e.g. images). For this reason, previous works have considered partial models, which model only part of the observa- tion. In this paper, we show that partial models can be causally incorrect: they are confounded by the observations they don’t model, and can there- fore lead to incorrect planning. To address this, we introduce a general family of partial models that are provably causally correct, yet remain fast because they do not need to fully model future observations.
